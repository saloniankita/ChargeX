## Problem Statement 
Analysis of the location for the Charging Stations of Electric Vehicles (EVs)

### Requirements -
 
An EV charging station must be placed in the area of 3 km x 3 km in cities and every 25 kilometres on both sides of roads, according to the government's infrastructure regulations. Every 100 kilometres on both sides of the highway, a charging station for long-range and heavy-duty vehicles should be located. 

To solve the Problem of Locating the Charging Stations, here are some FACTORS to be considered - 

•	Minimization of Cost

•	Maximization of Accessibility

•	Maximization of Utilization

For Setting up a charging station, cost should be minimum with maximum utilization and Accessibility. 

### Solution -

Creating an App/website which will analyse the Location according to demand and utilization and determines the best possible place to install the Charging Station, based on the given data.
This solution would be able to show the Maximum utilization factor and its Accessibility to the People, so that next station would be installed based on the existing network. 
We are integrating Real-Time data and the concept of machine learning to providing ±Accuracy and Proficiency to the Solution.
